# Penetration Test Guide based on the OWASP + Extra
This guid is for the penetration testers seeking for the appropriate test cases required during a penetration test project. I rearranged the [OWASP Testing Guide v4](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents) from my point of view including `9 Test Classes` and each class has several `Test Cases` to conduct against the target. Each `Test Case` covers several OWASP tests which also is useful for the report document. I've also added `15 extra Tests Cases` marked by the `EXTRA-TEST`. I hope it will be useful in both penetration test projects and bug-bounty.
